a = 10
b = 5

print(a + b)  # Addition
print(a - b)  # Subtraction
print(a * b)  # Multiplication
print(a / b)  # Division
print(a % b)  # Modulus



# 11. Tuples

# Tuples are immutable ordered collections of items.

# python

# my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "apple")
# print(my_tuple[1])  # Access the second element
