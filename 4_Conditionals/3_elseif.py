# Define a variable
number = 0

# # Conditional with elif
if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number == 0:
    print("The number is zero.")
else:
    print("The number is negative.")



# ------------------------------------------------------
# Using elif (else if)

# python

# # Define a variable
# number = 0

# # Conditional with elif
# if number > 0:
#     print("The number is positive.")
# elif number == 0:
#     print("The number is zero.")
# else:
#     print("The number is negative.")

# In this example, multiple conditions are checked:

#     If number > 0 is true, it prints "The number is positive."
#     If number == 0 is true, it prints "The number is zero."
#     If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "The number is negative."
