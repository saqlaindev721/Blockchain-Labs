# Using else

# python

# # Define a variable
# number = -5

# # Conditional with else
# if number > 0:
#     print("The number is positive.")
# else:
#     print("The number is zero or negative.")

# Here, if the condition number > 0 is false, the else block is executed, printing "The number is zero or negative."
