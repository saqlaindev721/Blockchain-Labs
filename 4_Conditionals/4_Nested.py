# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Nested Conditionals

# python

# # Define a variable
# number = 15

# # Nested conditionals
# if number > 0:
#     if number % 2 == 0:
#         print("The number is positive and even.")
#     else:
#         print("The number is positive and odd.")
# else:
#     print("The number is zero or negative.")

# Here, there are nested conditionals inside the first if block:

#     First, it checks if the number is positive.
#     Then, it checks if the number is even or odd using the condition number % 2 == 0.

# These examples illustrate the basic usage of conditionals in Python, allowing you to control the flow of your program based on different conditions.
# Variables and Data Types python code simple understand
